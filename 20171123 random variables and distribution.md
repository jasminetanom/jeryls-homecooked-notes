Continuous, any value within range
Ordinal variables, categorical with order stems from discrete

#Bernoulli
outcome is binary : 2 categories
> learn to translate from equations to code 
> eqs are mostly in LaTeX

#Binomial distribution
how many sucesses in n trials

#geometric distribution
how many failures before reach first success

#negative binomial distr
number of trials until the first r successes

#geome / hypergeometric
geo: number of failures with replacement until first success
hypergeo: number of failures without replacement

#poisson distribution
counts of positive success within time period

#exponential disribution
models amount of time until event occurs

#normal distribution
miu is mean of population
sigma is S.D. of population
