# Hierachical clustering

DIVISIVE
AGGLOMERATIVE


lowest level : single dot, one data point
go up the level: more data points

to tell HC dendrogram from trees,
length of split is different

# 2 phase clustering
1. first do k means, square root of observations
2. then do HC
centroids are individual data points
