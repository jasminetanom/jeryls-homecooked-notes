# Samplling  terms
sample: subset of pop
target pop
sample pop
sampling unit: unit that can be selected for sampling
Observaition unit: obj which measure is taken
sampling frame: a specification of units in population from sample may be selected.


Simple random sampling: random
Stratified sampling: grouped and then sampled equally
Cluster random sample: stratas are grouped into larger entity cluster and then sampled.

# Covariance
measure of how 2 variables change together, positive, move in same direction
negative move in opposite direction

# Probability
frequentist vs bayesian: frequentist is the traditional, pick and choose way

S sample space = all outcomes
F event = outcomes that is subset of sample space

# Conditional Prob
A|B = A n B / B

# Combinatorics
how many times X can happen in Y

# Recurssive functions
def factorial2(x):
    if x < 0:
        print("must be non-negative")
    if x == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        if x != int(x):
            print "must be integer"
        else:
            return x * factorial2(x-1)
return 1 is the break to the function
